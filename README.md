Vanderbilt University Epidemiology Doctoral Dissertation 2021

Each folder contains the code used to generate the tables and figures in my disseration, entitled "A couples-based intervention and postpartum contraceptive uptake in Zamb√©zia Province, Mozambique". This dissertation was completed as part of the requirements for a PhD in Epidemiology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.

Each folder only includes the code, folks interested in the primary data should contact me directly so we can go through the appropriate study procedures.

The disseration is available at https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17066

Folders
- Cleaning: the code used to clean each data source
- Chapters: the code generated to generate the tables and figures (and run the analyses) for each chapter
- Additional Code: any additional code, such as new or adapted functions outside of those in the .Rmd files (the chapter 4 and 5 .Rmd files also include some adpated functions)
